# Cereal-Data-
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and gaining insights from a dataset containing various cereals' nutritional information. Using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the goal of this project is to explore relationships between different nutritional values, identify trends, and gain a better understanding of the factors influencing cereal ratings.

Project Overview
The project analyzes a dataset of cereals, including attributes such as:

Manufacturer (mfr)
Cereal type (type)
Nutritional content: calories, protein, fat, sodium, fiber, carbohydrates, sugars, potassium, vitamins, etc.
Other attributes: shelf position, weight, cups per serving, and cereal ratings.
Key Objectives
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate and summarize basic statistics such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each nutritional value.
Correlation Analysis: Explore the relationships between different variables (e.g., calories vs. rating, sugars vs. rating) to uncover patterns and insights.
Visualization: Create visual representations such as histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps to communicate the findings.
Manufacturer & Type Analysis: Examine the distribution of cereals by manufacturer (mfr) and cereal type (hot/cold).
Data Insights
Descriptive Statistics: Summarized nutritional information such as average calories, protein, fat, fiber, and more.
Correlation Findings: Identification of correlations between nutritional components and ratings (e.g., do cereals with higher sugars tend to have lower ratings?).
Visualization: Clear and insightful graphs that reveal key patterns such as how cereal manufacturers compare in terms of total product count or how calorie distribution varies across different cereal types.
